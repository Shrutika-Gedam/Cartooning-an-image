# Cartooning-an-image
A real-time image processing application that transforms photos into various artistic styles including cartoon, comic, and pencil sketch effects. Built with OpenCV and Python, this interactive tool provides adjustable parameters to customize the artistic output. 

Features:
Multiple Art Styles: Choose between cartoon, comic, and pencil sketch effects
Adjustable Parameters: Fine-tune color levels, blur intensity, and edge thickness
Texture Overlays: Add canvas, dots, or crosshatch textures to your images
Background Options: Select between original, white, black, or gradient backgrounds
Real-time Preview: See changes instantly with interactive trackbars
Save Functionality: Export your processed images with a single keypress

How It Works:
The application uses various computer vision techniques:
Color Quantization: Reduces the number of colors in the image using k-means clustering
Edge Detection: Identifies important edges using adaptive thresholding
Smoothing: Applies bilateral filtering to preserve edges while reducing noise
Texture Generation: Creates pattern overlays for artistic effects
Background Replacement: Isolates foreground and replaces the background
